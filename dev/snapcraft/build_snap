# For debugging:
#  1) snapcraft define desktop-qt5
#  2) export QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1
#  3) export SNAPCRAFT_DEBUG=true
# Lessons learned:
#  1) executable must be built into root directory or else the relative path breaks the snap so executable is not found
#  2) snapcraft must be run in the root directory or else the executable is not included in the snap package
#  3) desktop-qt5 only snaps a minimal qt application, so other packages must be added by us
#  4) sql plugins must be added so sqlite is available, which prevents a runtime error message about missing qsqlite
#     that disappeared when the help feature started working
