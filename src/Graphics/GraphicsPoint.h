/// Graphics item for drawing a circular or polygonal Point.
///
/// In this class, lines are drawn twice:
/// 1) As nonzero-width lines so user can have thick, and highly visible, points
/// 2) As a 'shadow' with zero-width lines since these always appear even when
/// zooming results in some pixel
///    rows/columns disappearing
/// This dual-line approach is better than using
/// QGraphicsItem::ItemIgnoresTransformations to prevent horrible
/// aliasing problems, since that approach involves complicated transformation
/// matrix manipulations
///
/// Layering is used for the single graphics item contained by this class.
/// External code only has to deal with this
/// single class, and there is no multiple inheritance involved. If inheritance
/// was used, we would have one class
/// based on QGraphicsEllipseItem and another on QGraphicsPolygonItem, so having
/// a single class (for the convenience
/// of the external code) would involve multiple inheritance (of those two
/// classes). With the inheritance approach,
/// using just the methods supplied by QGraphicsItem would be inadequate.
