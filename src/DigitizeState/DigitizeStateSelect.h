  // Click and drag cases are:

  // 2) selection and moving with no initially selected items.
  //    Result = selection and movement of item under cursor
  // 3) selection and moving with only item under cursor initially selected
  //    Result = same result as case #2
  // 4) selection and moving with item under cursor not initially selected but
  // other item(s) selected
  //    Result = other items get unselected so the result is the same as case #2
  //    but with some items now unselected
  // 5) selection and moving with item under cursor initially selected along
  // with other selected items
  //    Result = all selected items get moved
  // Originally, determining if any object was under the cursor during
  // mousePressEvent was done with various hit tests, but
  // none were 100% consistent with the internal hit test done by the
  // QGraphicsView. The solution was to simply:
  // 1) Mark all items as unmoved when the mousePressEvent occurs
  // 2) Mark items that undergo QGraphicsItem::ItemScaleHasChanged as having
  // moved
  // 3) Harvest the results when the mouseReleaseEvent occurs
  // All moved items then have the currentCursorPosition - m_movingStart
  // translation applied to them
  QPointF m_movingStart;
