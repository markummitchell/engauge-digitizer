/// This class is a special case of the standard QGraphicsLineItem for guidelines,
/// and serves as the base class for the guideline state classes. This class has
/// a state machine to handle state-specific behavior for hovering, dragging, and
/// formatting.
///
/// General strategy:
/// 1) Four template Guidelines lie around the four scene borders
/// 2) A deployed Guideline is created by dragging a template Guideline from its original position
/// 3) When a (template or deployed) Guideline is dragged, the following process occurs
///    3a) The dragged Guideline becomes invisible, and its state changes to Handle
///    3b) A new deployed Guideline is generated where the dragged Guideline was located
///    3c) Dragging the Handle causes the same movements in the new deployed Guideline
///    3d) The new deployed Guideline is continually resized to just fit the scene, and in the
///        case of polar coordinates resized to go between origin and scene edge (theta) or
///        curved elliptically (range)
///    3e) At the end of the drag, the Handle is no longer needed so it transitions to Discarded state
///    3f) At the end of the drag, if it started with a template Guideline then a replacement
///        is put back on the scene edge
/// State transitions are diagrammed in the GuidelineStateContext class
///
/// This strategy works with the following constraints
/// 1) Since it is not the dragged object that we modify in 3d above, we can resize and adjust
///    the curvature of the visible new deployed Guideline as necessary
///
/// A simple way to describe this approach: Clicking and dragging involves the clicked Guideline
/// dying and a new Guideline being born in its place
///
/// State names are defined as:
/// # horizontal = Follows constant-y isocontour
/// # vertical = Follows constant-x isocontour
/// # template = One of the guidelines along every scene border that can be dragged
/// # deployed = One of the guidelines created by the user dragging a template guideline
/// # hide = Used when all Guidelines have been turned off
/// # hover = Applies when cursor is hovering over the Guideline, to add some highlighting
/// # normal = After a deployed Guideline has been created and lost the hover
/// # discarded = A noop state. The Guideline is no longer useful and has been removed
/// # handle = This Guideline is invisible, being dragged, and moving a bound deployed
///            Guideline along the same drag trajectory
/// # lurking = Template Guideline state for when active but not seen, and waiting for hover
///
/// There are two derived classes:
/// # one for drawing lines (cartesian and polar angle) with QGraphicsLineItem
/// # one for drawing ellipses (range angle) with QGraphicsEllipseItem
/// An attempt to draw lines with just QGraphicsEllipseItem, for simplicity, failed with
/// the result having sinusoidally changing line width.
