/// Cubic interpolation given independent and dependent value vectors. X is
/// handled as a dependent variable
/// based on the unitless independent parameter t so curves are not restricted
/// to x(i)!=x(i+1).
///
/// This class has two modes that can be run side by side:
/// -# Coefficient mode, where each interval has coefficients a,b,c,d in
/// xy=ai+bi*(t-ti)+ci*(t-ti)^2+di*(t-ti)^3
/// -# Bezier mode, where each interval has 2 endpoints and 2 control points in
///    P=(1-s)^3*P0+3*(1-s)^2*s*P1+3*(1-s)*s^2*P2+s^3*P3. Although interpolation
///    can be performed in bezier mode,
///    this interpolation was just to verify consistent operation between the
///    two modes. The real purpose of this
///    mode is to produce reliable control points, p1 and p2, for each interval.
///    The control points can be used by
///    external code that relies on control points to perform its own
///    interpolation
