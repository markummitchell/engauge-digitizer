/// Pick first simplest x value between specified min and max, for log scaling.

/// Examples:
/// -# 0.9 to 2, result is 1 which is 10^0
/// -# 1.1 to 9, result is sqrt(10) which is midway between 1 and 10 in log
/// scale, and equal to 10^0.5
/// -# 9.81 to 9.93, result is 10^0.992 since 9.81=10^0.99166 and 9.93=10^0.9969
