/// Callback for collecting axis points and then performing common calculations
/// on those axis points.
/// This class collects 3x3 matrix G which contains columns of graph
/// coordinates, and 3x3 matrix S
/// which contains columns of screen coordinates. Although it goes almost as far
/// as solving (G) = (T) (S)
/// for the transformation T, that is left for the Transformation class. This
/// class does, however, do the
/// sanity checking (like for collinear points) so the gui can provide immediate
/// feedback to the user
/// well before the Transformation class gets involved
///
/// This class is versatile. The cases are:
/// -# Use all existing axis points, and then the subclass can effectively
/// append one more point to check if that
///    additional point would violate any constraints (prior to adding the
///    point)
/// -# Use all existing axis points, but override the details of one existing
/// axis point to see if those
///    details violate any constraint (prior to editing the point)
/// -# Use all existing axis points as is. This is for computing the
/// transformation after axis points are added/edited
